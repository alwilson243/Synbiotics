Title:  5,10-@METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE; MTHFR
Gene Function: Liu et al. (2000) found that most endogenous or transfected SPHK2 activity in human embryonic kidney cells was associated with the cytosolic fraction, while 26% was associated with membranes. Biochemical characterization of recombinant SPHK2 revealed a preference for D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine as substrate and a pH optima of 7.5. Salts, specifically KCl, increased the rate of reaction, in contrast to the inhibition found with SPHK1. The authors also noted some difference in substrate specificity between SPHK2 and SPHK1. Hait et al. (2009) found that SPHK2, one of the isoenzymes that generates S1P, was associated with histone H3 and produced S1P that regulated histone acetylation. S1P specifically bound to the histone deacetylases HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164) and inhibited their enzymatic activity, preventing the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histone tails. SPHK2 associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in repressor complexes and was selectively enriched at the promoters of the genes encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (116899) or the transcriptional regulator c-fos (164810), where it enhanced local histone H3 acetylation and transcription. Thus, Hait et al. (2009) concluded that HDACs are direct intracellular targets of S1P and link nuclear S1P to epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPHK2 gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG26816). Lymphocytes require sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor-1 (S1P1; 601974) to exit lymphoid organs. By using mice in which the 2 kinases that generate S1P, SPHK1 and SPHK2, were conditionally ablated, Pappu et al. (2007) found that plasma S1P is mainly hematopoietic in origin, with erythrocytes as a major contributor, whereas lymph S1P is from a distinct radiation-resistant source. Lymphocyte egress from thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was markedly reduced in kinase-deficient mice. Restoration of S1P to plasma rescued egress to blood but not lymph, and the rescue required lymphocyte expression of S1P1. Thus, Pappu et al. (2007) concluded that separate sources provide S1P to plasma and lymph to help lymphocytes exit the low-S1P environment of lymphoid organs. Pappu et al. (2007) proposed that disruption of compartmentalized S1P signaling is a plausible mechanism by which S1P1 agonists function as immunosuppressives. Camerer et al. (2009) found that mice selectively lacking S1P in plasma (Pappu et al., 2007) exhibited increased vascular leak and impaired survival after anaphylaxis, administration of platelet activating factor (PAF; see 173393) or histamine, or exposure to related inflammatory challenges. Increased leak was associated with increased interendothelial cell gaps in venules and could be reversed by transfusion with wildtype erythrocytes, which restored plasma S1P levels, or by acute treatment with an S1pr1 agonist. S1pr1 agonist did not protect wildtype mice from PAF-induced leak. However, an agonist for Par2 (F2RL1; 600933) protected wildtype mice from PAF-induced leak, and this protection was lost after systemic treatment with pertussis toxin. Camerer et al. (2009) suggested that blood communicates with blood vessels via plasma S1P to maintain vascular integrity. Mizugishi et al. (2007) showed that the sphingolipid metabolic pathway was highly activated in the deciduum of mice during pregnancy and that disturbance of this pathway by disruption of Sphk genes caused defective decidualization with severely compromised uterine blood vessels, leading to early pregnancy loss. Sphk-deficient (Sphk1 -/- Sphk2 +/-) female mice exhibited both an enormous accumulation of dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine and a reduction in phosphatidylethanolamine levels in pregnant uteri. These mice showed increased cell death in decidual cells, decreased cell proliferation in undifferentiated stromal cells, and massive breakage of decidual blood vessels, leading to uterine hemorrhage and early embryonic lethality. Mizugishi et al. (2007) concluded that sphingolipid metabolism regulates proper uterine decidualization and blood vessel stability.

Title:  ALG6, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ALG6
Description: By searching EST databases and using low-stringency PCR amplification to screen a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library, Imbach et al. (1999) obtained a complete cDNA encoding the ortholog of S. cerevisiae ALG5. The human ALG5 protein contains 242 amino acids and is 58% similar to yeast ALG5. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.3-kb ALG5 transcript in pancreas, placenta, liver, heart, brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, and lung. Gross (2014) mapped the ALG5 gene to chromosome 13q13.3 based on an alignment of the ALG5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF161498) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).
